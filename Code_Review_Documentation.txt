Documentation of my thought process for this code review
  Overall
  - Break up the index.html file into separate files for css and js
    - Break up the js script tag into three separate files based on what their labeled sections.
  - Run linter on JS files for syntax fixes
    - Use airbnb linter
  
  For index.html
  - Change template to HTML5 instead of HTML4.01 strict
  - Include language attribute
  - Include meta tag for charset
  - Change title tage to reflect application purpose
  - Add Bootstrap library for quick easy style base
  - Add Bootstrap to help make responsive

  For style.css
  - Style for more responsive design
  - Add a bit more padding 
  - Style header for a bit of pop
  - Set width of controls area bigger so they all fit on one line
  - Set height of table rows to 100 vs image height to avoid stretched images
  - Set background color of even numbered table rows to be gray to help with differentiating
  - Set background color of table header to match even rows

  For JS overall
  - Use consistent function declarations (Fat arrow preferred)
  - Use consistent line endings (semi-colons preferred)
  - Add default image for lack of image or for error messages

  For apiCall.js
  - Change error location to be inside a catch statemnet
  - Change error message to print out error being thrown to the console
  - Populate array with an error message to show in view

  For dataTransform.js
  - Extend 'filterByName' for wider search
    - Search letter by letter instead of by entire string (Allows for list narrowing)
    - Search by full name instead of just first or last
    - Format search query to be non case sensative and to ignore white space
    - Return no one found message if no results match
    - Return the whole list if search box contains no characters (with the exception of space characters)
  - Change 'sortByLastName' to sort by lastname prop instead of reversing list sorted by firstname prop

  For views.js
    - Add header to page that explains application purpose
    - Add placeholder to search field to explain its purpose
    - Change wording of buttons to be more organic
    - Change table column label "Thumbnail" to a more recognized word
    - Add class to table rows differentiating odds and evens
    - Create new div for controls
    - Change key for people mapping to use id instead of index
    - Include logic for thumbnail to handle undefined image urls


- For the future
  - Would move to an actual react application
  - Would require linter in package.json
