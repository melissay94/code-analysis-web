<!-- Welcome!
     ========

     This is a list view for employees that work at WillowTree.


     What it does:
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     - Lists employees photos & names.
     - Search for an employee by name.
     - Sort employees by their first names.
     - Sort empolyees by their last names.
     - Shuffle the list order (because why not).

     Implementation details:
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     - No compile stepâ€”Just open this file in a browser.
     - The view layer is written in React (without JSX).
       * If you don't know React, don't fret! The logic lives
         outside of it for the most part.


     So... what now?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Take a look at the code. It works on the surface, but can it be
     improved? Are there things that you would do differently?

     Change it & Have fun!


     Misc. Notes
     ~~~~~~~~~~~

     This code is only expected to work in the latest version of
     Google Chrome. Feel free to use all the latest & greatest
     things that are offered (new API's for JS, CSS, etc.).

     Currently this project does _not_ have a build step (i.e. it runs
     directly by opening the file in Google Chrome). If you finish
     with improvements & feel like there isn't much else to do _then_
     add in a build step if you wish. This is NOT strictly required.
